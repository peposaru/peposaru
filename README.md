Hi, I'm Keenan ðŸ‘‹
I am very interested in taking things apart and understanding how they work. I have taken apart cars, homes, electrical systems, computers, clothing, and more. I like learning what makes something a poor-quality product and what makes something a high-quality product. I do my best to create something I can be proud to stand behind.

Technologies & Tools
- Python (Data analysis and scripting)
- Data visualization (Tableau, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Web scraping (BeautifulSoup, Selenium)
- Geospatial tools (QGIS, ArcGIS, GeoServer)
  
Libraries & Frameworks I Use Frequently
 - Pandas (Data manipulation)
 - Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data visualization)
 - BeautifulSoup/Selenium (Web scraping)
 - QGIS/ArcGIS (Geospatial analysis)
 - PostgreSQL (Database management)
  
Areas of Expertise
 - eCommerce: Scraping and analyzing product data
 - Geospatial analysis: Working with tools like QGIS and GeoServer for spatial data
 - Data scraping: Automating the extraction of data from websites
 - Antiques: Extensive experience in buying, selling, trading, and restoring antiques

âš¡ Fun fact: I like making custom packs and bags for friends and family.
